## 🛠️ How to Run (Development)
If you want to modify the code or contribute:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(This installs dependencies for both client and server)*

2.  **Start the App**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will launch the Electron application window.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    To create the `.exe` installer:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run make
    ```

    **Build Linux AppImage**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run make:appimage
    ```

    **Build Windows 32-bit Zip** (on Linux):
    ```bash
    cd server
    npx electron-forge package --arch=ia32 --platform=win32
    mkdir -p out/make/zip/win32-ia32
    cd out/ClassSend-win32-ia32 && zip -r ../make/zip/win32-ia32/ClassSend-win32-ia32-6.7.0.zip .
    ```

## 🏗️ Architecture
ClassSend is built with:
- **Electron**: For the desktop application wrapper.
- **Node.js & Express**: For the internal server that handles socket connections.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time bidirectional communication.
- **Vanilla JS / HTML / CSS**: For the frontend interface.

### Why Electron?
We use Electron to bundle the Node.js server *inside* the application. This means:
1.  **Zero Configuration**: Users don't need to install Node.js or configure IP addresses manually.
2.  **Standalone**: It runs as a single `.exe` file.
3.  **Offline Capable**: It creates its own local server, perfect for schools with restricted internet.

This project was **vibecoded** using **Antigravity Gemini 3 Pro** and **Claude 4.5**, showcasing the capabilities and limitations of modern AI-assisted development.

### Architectural Evolution: Monolithic vs. Modular

During development, we attempted to transition from a **monolithic structure** to a more **modular architecture**. This experiment revealed interesting insights about AI-assisted coding:

#### Monolithic Architecture
- **Challenge**: Memory and context window limitations with too many lines of code in single files
- **Impact**: As files grew larger, the AI models struggled to maintain full context
- **Result**: Slower development and increased error rates as codebase expanded

#### Modular Architecture
- **Advantages**: 
  - Files were coded **faster** with **fewer errors** initially
  - Clearer separation of concerns
  - Easier for AI to focus on individual components
- **Challenges**: 
  - **Lost connection context**: As the number of modules increased, the meaning and relationships between files became harder to track
  - **Integration complexity**: Understanding how components interact across multiple files proved difficult
  - **Context fragmentation**: AI models lost sight of the "big picture" when dealing with many small files

#### The Verdict

While both approaches presented challenges, we found that:
- **Errors increase** with codebase size **regardless of architecture**
- **Modular structure** enabled faster initial development and fewer syntax errors
- **Understanding and maintaining** a modular file structure proved **slightly more difficult** in the end
- **Context coherence**: The monolithic approach, despite its limitations, sometimes maintained better overall understanding of system state

This experience highlights an important consideration for AI-assisted development: **architectural choices should balance AI capabilities with human maintainability**. The "perfect" structure may depend on project size, team composition, and the specific AI tools being used.

### What We Learned
- AI coding assistants excel at **focused, well-defined tasks** in smaller files
- **Cross-file relationships** and **system-wide state** remain challenging for current AI models
- **Hybrid approaches** may be optimal: modular where possible, but not at the expense of coherence
- **Clear documentation** and **explicit interfaces** become even more critical with AI-assisted development
