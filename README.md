## 📖 How to Use
1.  **Start the App**: Open ClassSend on the teacher's computer.
2.  **Create a Class**: Enter a Class ID (e.g., "Math") and your name.
3.  **Connect Students**:
    *   Click the **Globe Icon (🌐)** in the top header.
    *   **Option A (Easiest)**: Toggle "Short Name" ON. Students type `http://math.local:3000` in their browser.
    *   **Option B (Reliable)**: If on a **mobile hotspot** or if Option A fails, toggle "Standard IP" ON. Students type the IP address shown (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:3000`).
4.  **Share**: Drag and drop files or type messages. Everything is shared instantly over the local network!

## 🌟 Core Features

- **Local Network**: Runs entirely on your local network (LAN). No internet required.
- **Linux AppImage**: `ClassSend-8.4-temp-x64.AppImage`
- **Linux Zip**: `ClassSend-linux-x64-8.4-temp.zip`
- **Windows Installer (64-bit)**: `ClassSend-8.4-temp Setup.exe`

## 🧠 Offline AI Setup (Required for Deep Learning)
The "Deep Learning" filter requires the `toxic-bert` model, which is excluded from this repository due to size limits.

To enable it:
1.  Download the **Xenova/toxic-bert** model (ONNX quantized) from Hugging Face.
2.  Place the files in: `server/models/Xenova/toxic-bert/onnx/`
3.  Ensure `model_quantized.onnx` is present in that folder.

## 🛠️ How to Run (Development)
If you want to modify the code or contribute:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(This installs dependencies for both client and server)*

2.  **Start the App**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will launch the Electron application window.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    To create the `.exe` installer:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run make
    ```

    **Build Linux AppImage**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run make:appimage
    ```

    **Build Windows 32-bit Zip** (on Linux):
    ```bash
    cd server
    npx electron-forge package --arch=ia32 --platform=win32
    mkdir -p out/make/zip/win32-ia32
    cd out/ClassSend-win32-ia32 && zip -r ../make/zip/win32-ia32/ClassSend-win32-ia32-7.0.0.zip .
    ```

## 🏗️ Architecture
ClassSend is built with:
- **Electron**: For the desktop application wrapper.
- **Node.js & Express**: For the internal server that handles socket connections.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time bidirectional communication.
- **Vanilla JS / HTML / CSS**: For the frontend interface.

### Why Electron?
We use Electron to bundle the Node.js server *inside* the application. This means:
1.  **Zero Configuration**: Users don't need to install Node.js or configure IP addresses manually.
2.  **Standalone**: It runs as a single `.exe` file.
3.  **Offline Capable**: It creates its own local server, perfect for schools with restricted internet.
