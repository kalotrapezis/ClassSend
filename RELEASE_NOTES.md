# Release Notes - v6.0.0

## 🚀 New Features

### 🇬🇷 Greek Language Support (NEW)
Full translation of the application interface into Greek.

- **Persistent Choice**: Your language preference is saved and remembered for future sessions.

### 📺 Improved Screen Sharing (NEW)
Major enhancements to the teacher's screen broadcasting experience.
- **Pinned Join Message**: When a teacher starts sharing, a pinned message appears automatically in chat, making it easy for students to find the stream.
