# Release Notes

## [11.5.1] - 2026-05-12

### NEW
- **Multi-NIC Teacher Support**: A teacher PC with two ethernet ports on two different subnets can now host a single class with students from **both** subnets at the same time. The server enumerates every usable NIC, advertises all of them via Bonjour (`ips` TXT field, CSV) alongside the legacy single `ip`, and the discovery endpoints (`/api/ping`, `/api/discovery-info`, `get-server-info`, `network-info`) pick the NIC IP on the subnet the requesting student actually came in on. Old single-NIC clients are unchanged. See `ClassSend2`'s `MULTI-NIC-BUG.md` for the underlying analysis.
- **Same-Subnet-First Discovery (strict)**: The student's `probeKnownServers` now splits cached candidates into "same subnet as my NIC" vs "everything else" and races the first group; the second is only attempted if every same-subnet probe misses. Most schools have one network, so this eliminates the wasted seconds spent probing an unreachable foreign subnet. Single-NIC environments incur zero extra latency.
- **Multi-NIC Known-Servers History**: Each cached teacher entry now stores `ips: string[]` — every IP the teacher advertised the last time we saw it. `expandCandidates` emits one probe URL per known NIC IP, so a student that switched subnets between sessions still finds the teacher.
- **Per-Message Filter Bypass Button (Teacher Only)**: A new button using `filter-slash.svg` appears in the teacher's message box only **after** a message is blocked by the content filter. One click resends that exact message past every filter stage; the button hides immediately and re-arms only if the next message is blocked again. Students can never see or trigger it — the server enforces the role gate even if the client flag is spoofed.
- **Seeded Wordlists on First Boot**: A fresh install now ships 51 blacklist + 43 whitelist entries (real classroom data from 2026-04-29) so the filter isn't overprotective out of the box. Whitelist's job is exclusively the pre-AI hard-pass — it is **no longer trained as `clean`** in the Naive Bayes model (training it inflated unrelated n-grams: `fast` learned as clean was leaking into `fak`). Existing installs are not re-seeded; the `data/.seeded` marker file guards against overwrites.

### FIXES
- **Connection Indicator Stuck**: The connected/disconnected dot could get stuck on either state after laptop sleep/wake, WebSocket transport-level drops, or mid-reconnect. New `syncConnectionUI()` reads `socket.connected` as the source of truth and is bound to `connect`, `disconnect`, `reconnect_attempt`, `reconnect_failed`, `visibilitychange`, and a 5-second heartbeat. A new `connecting` visual state surfaces during reconnect attempts.
- **Late-Joining Students Missed Class Settings**: The `join-class` callback already shipped `autoDownloadEnabled` / `autoDownloadPath`, but the client dropped them on the floor — students who joined *after* the teacher set the toggle never auto-downloaded files until the teacher toggled it again. Client now reads them into `joinedClasses` on join. Added `urlWhitelist` to the join response so students have the whitelist ready before internet-cut is ever enabled.
- **Network-Change Rebroadcast on Multi-NIC**: When the teacher's network changes, the IP-change rebroadcast now goes per-socket — each client gets the IP on the subnet it's actually connected from, not the global primary IP.

### INTERNALS
- New `client/subnet-match.js` — pure helpers (`ipv4ToInt`, `isSameSubnet`, `extractIPv4`, `partitionCandidates`, `raceWithFallback`) that drive the same-subnet-first probe ordering. Dependency-free so they're testable in Node.
- New `server/data/seed-wordlists.js` — first-boot seed data and asEntries helpers.
- New `get-local-nics` IPC handler in `server/electron-main.js` so the renderer can ask the main process which subnets it's on.
- `NetworkDiscovery` gained `getAllLocalNICs`, `getAllLocalIPs`, `pickAdvertiseAddrFor(remoteIP)`. `findServers` now surfaces an `ips[]` array alongside the single `ip`. Network monitor compares the full NIC set, not just the primary, so a non-primary NIC going down is detected too.

### TESTS
- Old vitest suite moved to `server/tests-old/` (preserved, not deleted).
- Fresh suite written from scratch — **104 tests across 7 files**, full run in ~1.3 s:
  - `network-discovery.test.js` (22) — `pickAdvertiseAddrFor` across /24 /16, IPv4-mapped IPv6, loopback, garbage, single-NIC; mDNS class encode/decode round-trip incl. Greek.
  - `known-servers.test.js` (29) — rich-history load/save, legacy migration, identity matching (serverId > mac > host > url), case-insensitive host, multi-NIC `ips[]` merge, quota-exceeded localStorage tolerance, MAX_ENTRIES cap.
  - `subnet-match.test.js` (23) — `ipv4ToInt` rejecting garbage, `isSameSubnet` across /24 /16 /30, `partitionCandidates` ordering preservation, 5000-candidate budget.
  - `endpoints.test.js` (8) — real Express app, header-injected `req.ip`, proves `/api/ping` + `/api/discovery-info` route per-subnet and survive 50 concurrent requests.
  - `race-ordering.test.js` (8) — strict "phase 2 never starts before phase 1 ends", parallel timing inside a phase, throwing probes don't crash a round, cold-start fallback.
  - `stress.test.js` (8) — 30 concurrent students hitting the same endpoint, 800 ms artificial latency timeout handling, heap-drift on 1000 picks, unicode/RTL hostnames, JSON-bomb in TXT decode.
  - `seed-wordlists.test.js` (6) — non-empty lists, lowercase + trimmed normalization, no duplicates, no overlap between the two lists, valid `SEED_VERSION` date.
- New `vitest.config.js` scopes the run to `server/tests/**` and excludes stale `.claude/worktrees/` paths.

## [11.4.0] - 2026-05-07

### NEW
- **MAC + Hostname Aware Discovery**: The server now exposes a stable identity (`serverId`, `hostname`, `mac`) on `GET /api/discovery-info` and a new lightweight `GET /api/ping` used for fast first-hit probing. The client persists this rich info per known server so a teacher PC whose IP changes via DHCP is still found instantly via its hostname or MAC.
- **Race-Based Parallel Probing**: Each known-server entry expands to multiple candidate URLs (recorded IP, `http://hostname:port`, `http://hostname.local:port`) and all are probed concurrently with a 2.5 s ceiling. Results are deduplicated by `serverId`. This fully replaces the old sequential `7s × N` probe loop that caused 7-8 of 10 PCs to freeze on cold start.
- **Continuous Background Discovery**: A 6-second heartbeat re-probes known servers while the student is in the Lobby, so a teacher who comes online *after* the students are already booted is auto-detected within seconds. The heartbeat stops automatically once the student joins a real class — no idle cost at steady state.
- **Three-Path Auto-Connect**:
  1. **History probe** (always on, plain HTTP — works in locked-down school networks).
  2. **mDNS broadcast** (toggle, default ON — for first-ever boot when no history exists; harmless if blocked by school firewall).
  3. **Manual-connect fallback** — if neither yields a class within 12 s, the manual IP entry dialog opens automatically so the user can type the teacher's IP/hostname.
- **Users-List Search Bar (ClassSend2-style)**: New search input above the users list with substring + Levenshtein-≤1 fuzzy matching. Hostname-aware sort means `Lab1, Lab2, Lab10` instead of `Lab1, Lab10, Lab2`.
- **Hostname as Default Username**: First-time users now get the machine hostname (via `os.hostname()`) instead of a random "Happy Lemon"-style name. The dice button in Settings now resets to hostname rather than rolling random.

### FIXES
- **Name Auto-Overwrite**: Changing the language no longer regenerates the username, which was silently overwriting names users had typed in.
- **Duplicate `blocked` Key in `join-class` Callback**: The server's join callback had two `blocked` keys; the second silently overwrote the first, losing the per-socket "is this user blocked" bit. Removed the duplicate.
- **Bounded Join History**: The server now caps the message history sent to joiners at the most recent 200 messages. Joins were sending the entire log (including media references) to every joiner — a hidden bottleneck under burst joins of 10+ students.

### PERFORMANCE
- Removed the 500 ms artificial delay on boot probe — discovery now fires immediately when the network is online.
- New `/api/ping` is a tiny JSON identity-only endpoint, used for first-hit detection before fetching the heavier `/api/discovery-info`.
- Probe candidate set deduplicates own origin and (host / .local / IP) variants of the same machine before issuing requests.
- Capped 200-message join history reduces per-joiner payload from unbounded to ≤ 200 messages.

### TESTS
- New unit suite: `hostname-sort.test.js`, `known-servers.test.js`, `connection-probe.test.js`, `discovery-endpoints.test.js`, `smoke.test.js` (live integration). 21 unit tests + 3 live smoke tests, all passing.

## [11.3.1] - 2026-03-19

### FIXES
- **Students Stuck After Teacher Disconnect**: When the teacher left and created a new class, 8 out of 9 students would stay frozen in the dead class instead of automatically finding and joining the new one. Two separate bugs caused this:
  1. The `class-ended` handler called the browser's built-in `alert()` dialog, which freezes JavaScript completely while it waits for a click. While the dialog sat open, the server sent the `active-classes` broadcast containing the teacher's new class. That event executed after the dialog was dismissed — but at that point `currentClassId` was still the old class, so `handleAutoFlow()` silently returned without doing anything. Students ended up staring at the scanning spinner with no further trigger. Fixed by removing the blocking `alert()` and immediately re-arming and calling `handleAutoFlow()` after going to the scanning state.
  2. For students whose socket reconnected after the class was already deleted: `joinClass()` would fail, set `autoFlowTriggered = false`, and wait for the next socket reconnect to retry. But no reconnect was coming — the socket was already connected. The next `active-classes` event called `handleAutoFlow()`, which immediately returned because `autoFlowTriggered` was false. Fixed by keeping `autoFlowTriggered = true` and calling `handleAutoFlow()` directly after the failed join instead of waiting.

---

## [11.3.0] - 2026-03-18

### NEW
- **Command Acknowledgment (Handshake)**: When the teacher sends a command (lock screen, cut internet, open app, close all apps, shutdown, etc.), each student PC now sends back a confirmation after executing it. The teacher's PC receives a per-student acknowledgment showing the student's **name** and **PC name**. If a student's confirmation does not arrive within 5 seconds, the server automatically resends the command to that student — up to 3 retries — before giving up. This ensures commands reliably reach every PC even on flaky classroom networks.
- **Active State Applied to Late Joiners**: Students who join a class after the teacher has already issued a class-wide command now receive the current state immediately on join. Specifically: if internet cutoff is active when a student connects, their internet is blocked automatically; if screen lock is active, their screen is locked automatically. Previously these students would join in an unlocked/unrestricted state until the teacher re-issued the command.

### INTERNALS
- Added `pendingCommandAcks` map and `sendCommandWithAck` / `removePendingAcksForSocket` / `clearPendingAcksForClass` helpers in `server/index.js`.
- `classData` objects now carry `internetCutActive`, `internetCutPayload`, and `lockScreenActive` fields to persist class-wide command state across joins.
- All seven command handlers (`trigger-lock-screen`, `trigger-unlock-screen`, `trigger-disable-internet`, `trigger-enable-internet`, `trigger-shutdown`, `trigger-focus`, `trigger-close-all-apps`) route through `sendCommandWithAck`.
- Pending ack entries are cleaned up immediately when a student leaves/disconnects or when a class is deleted, preventing stale retry timers.
- Client-side `execute-*` handlers emit `command-ack` after execution; internet commands wait for the Electron IPC promise to resolve before acking; shutdown acks before invoking (the PC won't be online to ack afterwards).

## [11.2.4] - 2026-03-18

### FIXES
- **Heartbeat Watchdog (corrected)**: The watchdog now only arms itself after the first heartbeat arrives from the renderer — preventing a false-positive reload loop that occurred during startup when the preload script hadn't yet exposed `ipcRenderer`. The previous implementation started the 20-second countdown immediately on `did-finish-load`, which could cause the app to reload before the heartbeat sender had a chance to initialize, creating an infinite reload cycle that disconnected students.
- **Auto-Connect Race Condition**: Fixed a timing issue where students on the teacher's server would sit in the Lobby instead of auto-joining the class. When the socket first connected, `handleAutoFlow()` ran before the class list arrived from the server (`active-classes` is async). This blocked the class list response from triggering auto-join via `joiningInProgress`. After the Lobby join completes, the app now immediately re-requests the class list so `handleAutoFlow()` gets a clean, unblocked attempt.

---

## [11.2.3] - 2026-03-16

### FIXES
- **Heartbeat Watchdog**: The app now actively monitors whether the renderer is alive via a heartbeat signal sent every 5 seconds. If the renderer goes silent for 20 seconds (soft freeze, stuck promise, or silent crash) the main process automatically reloads it. This complements the existing `unresponsive` event handler, which only catches hard input-blocking freezes.
- **Emergency Internet Recovery Command**: The "Persist Internet Cutoff" helper command now also deletes the `ProxyServer` and `ProxyOverride` registry keys in addition to disabling `ProxyEnable`. Previously, only disabling the proxy flag left the `127.0.0.1:81` proxy address in the registry, causing the app to crash after running the command and requiring a manual trip to Windows Internet Settings to fully clear the proxy.

---

## [11.2.2] - 2026-03-12

### NEW
- **Restart if Unresponsive**: A new toggle in Settings → Administration lets you register ClassSend with Windows Error Reporting so that Windows automatically relaunches the app if it is terminated for being unresponsive. Enabled by default on new installs.

### CHANGES
- **Internet Cutoff Persistence: Off by Default**: The "Persist Internet Cutoff After Reboot" toggle now defaults to OFF on new installs. Internet blocking is no longer automatically restored after a student PC reboots unless the teacher explicitly enables the setting.

---

## [11.2.1] - 2026-03-11

### NEW
- **Internet Whitelist Quick-Add Presets**: New "Quick add" buttons (Google, YouTube, Microsoft) in the Internet Cutoff whitelist automatically add all domains a service needs — fixing cases where google.gr worked but Google still failed due to missing gstatic.com and googleapis.com.
- **Internet Whitelist www. Fix**: Entering a domain with a www. prefix (e.g. www.google.com) now correctly strips it to google.com, ensuring the proxy bypass covers the bare domain and all subdomains.
- **Auto-Recovery from Frozen App**: The app now detects when its renderer process becomes unresponsive and reloads itself automatically — no teacher or student action needed.
- **Monitoring: Sequential Image Sending**: Student PCs now send screenshots in a staggered sequence (1.2 s apart) instead of all at once, eliminating network bursts that caused slow or missing thumbnails in large classes.
- **Monitoring: Late-Joining Students**: Students who join a class after monitoring is already enabled now receive screenshots automatically — previously they were silently skipped until the teacher restarted monitoring.
- **Monitoring: Thumbnail Quality Setting**: A new "Thumbnail Quality" selector in Settings → Screen Sharing lets the teacher choose between Very Low (160×90) and Low (320×180). The setting syncs to all connected students instantly.
- **Focus View Without Prior Image**: The teacher can now click any student card to open the focus/high-res view even if no thumbnail has arrived yet — the high-res frame is requested immediately on click.
- **Internet Cutoff Persistence Toggle**: A new toggle in Settings → Connection lets the teacher control whether internet blocking is restored on student PCs after a reboot. Syncs to all connected students.

### FIXES
- **Advanced Filter Fix**: Fixed a bug where the AI content filter blocked every message regardless of the sensitivity threshold. Words not in the classifier's vocabulary no longer fall back to the skewed training prior.

## [11.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### NEW
- **Config File (`classsend.conf`)**: A plain-text configuration file is now placed next to the executable after installation (`C:\Program Files\ClassSend\resources\classsend.conf`). IT administrators can edit it with any text editor before or after deployment; a restart applies the changes. Configurable options include: role, port, TLS, auto-start, internet restore on startup, max file size, screen capture quality and resolution, socket buffer size, logging, and AI thresholds.
- **Improved Monitoring Quality**: Student screen capture now supports configurable resolution (`low` 320×180 · `1080p` · `1440p` · `4k`) and JPEG compression tied to streaming bandwidth (8 / 16 / 32 / 64 Mbit → quality 25 / 50 / 72 / 88). Frames are sent as JPEG instead of PNG, significantly reducing per-frame payload.
- **Dynamic About Page**: The version number and "Recent Improvements" list in Settings → About are now injected at build time from `client/package.json` and `client/release-notes.js` respectively — no more manual HTML edits per release.

### FIXES
- **Tool Button Reliability**: Teacher tools (Lock Screen, Internet Cutoff, Shutdown, Focus App, Close All Apps) would silently do nothing after a brief network reconnect because an internal logic inversion (`autoFlowTriggered = true` instead of `false`) left `currentClassId` as `null` indefinitely. The flag is now correctly reset, the teacher triggers auto-recovery after 2 seconds, and all five affected buttons show a clear warning toast instead of silently failing.
- **Window Focus Restoration**: Clicking the ClassSend window with the mouse no longer fails to restore keyboard focus on Windows. Root causes fixed: `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()` is now Linux-only (on Windows it forced software/WARP rendering which broke `WM_MOUSEACTIVATE`); `focus()` is now called after tray `show()`, on the `show` event, and after the lock screen overlay is dismissed.
- **TAB Keyboard Navigation**: TAB order corrected — the Tools toggle button is now first in DOM order and reached before the hidden menu items inside it. Tool menu buttons carry `tabindex="-1"` by default and are promoted to `tabindex="0"` only while the menu is open.

## [11.1.2] - 2026-03-09
### FIXES
- **Auto Client Build**: `npm run make` now automatically builds the client (Vite) before packaging the installer. Previously the client had to be built manually first, causing stale bundles to ship if the step was skipped.

## [11.1.1] - 2026-03-09
### FIXES
- **Missing Modules on Install**: `network-discovery.js` and `file-storage.js` were not included in the electron-builder file list, causing the server to fail on startup with "Cannot find module" after installation. Both files are now correctly packed into the app bundle.
- **Role Not Persisting (Teacher)**: After installation, the Teacher role was not being retained between launches. On every startup the app would show the role selection screen again, forcing the teacher to re-select their role manually. Fixed by routing the `socket.on('connect')` auto-flow to `triggerTeacherAutoFlow()` for teachers instead of the student-only `handleAutoFlow()`.
- **Wrong Role on First Launch**: Fresh installs always defaulted to the Student role regardless of what was selected during the installer's Teacher/Student setup page. The installer-chosen role (stored in `HKLM\SOFTWARE\ClassSend\Mode`) is now read via IPC on first launch and saved to local storage, so the app opens with the correct role immediately without any user interaction.
- **EPERM on Startup (Media Directory)**: The server failed to start after installation with `EPERM: operation not permitted, mkdir 'C:\Program Files\ClassSend\media'`. Both `file-storage.js` and `index.js` were trying to create the media folder inside the read-only `Program Files` installation directory. Both now use the writable `userData` path (`AppData\Roaming\ClassSend\`) instead.

## [11.1.0] - 2026-03-08
### CONNECTION BLOCKING WHITELIST
- **Whitelist Modal**: The "No Internet" tool is now a persistent modal instead of a simple toggle. Teachers can manage a URL whitelist alongside the on/off switch — adding a domain (e.g. `google.gr`) automatically allows all paths and subdomains without extra configuration.
- **Persistent State**: Internet blocking state is saved and restored automatically on app restart. If blocking was active when the app closed, it re-applies on next launch with the same whitelist.
- **Translations**: All modal text is fully translated into English and Greek and respects the app language setting.

## [11.0.0] - 2026-03-08
### INSTALLER & ROLE MANAGEMENT
- **Proper Windows Installer**: Migrated from the silent Squirrel installer to a full NSIS wizard (electron-builder). Shows a proper installation dialog with progress and options.
- **Teacher / Student Role Selection**: The installer now asks "Who will use ClassSend on this computer?" during setup. The selected role is written to the registry and remembered permanently — no more hidden unlock codes or manual role switching after install.
- **System-wide Installation**: ClassSend now installs to `Program Files` (per-machine) instead of the user's AppData folder, making it available to all accounts on the machine.
- **No-prompt Auto-start**: Auto-start on login is registered as a Windows Scheduled Task during installation. The app launches at login without any UAC consent popup.

### STUDENT NETWORK PROTECTION
- **WiFi Guard Service**: Student installations register a background system task (`ClassSend WiFi Guard`) that starts at boot as the SYSTEM account. It silently reverts any attempt to enable Airplane mode or administratively disable the WiFi adapter every 5 seconds. Students cannot stop or modify this process.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Uninstalling ClassSend removes both the app startup task and the WiFi Guard task.

## [10.5.7] - 2026-03-06
### NETWORK RESILIENCE & STARTUP
- **Wait for Network**: The application now intelligently waits for a valid LAN IP at startup. If the PC is in Airplane mode or still searching for WiFi, the splash screen will display a status message instead of showing a blank screen.
- **Auto-Restart Recovery**: Implemented a 30-second watchdog that automatically restarts the application if a network connection or local server cannot be established within the timeout period.
- **Dynamic IP Monitoring**: The server now actively monitors for network interface changes (e.g., switching from WiFi to Ethernet). It automatically updates its IP, re-publishes mDNS services, and notifies all connected clients in real-time.
- **Connection Error Screen**: Replaced the "blank screen" failure mode with a modern, user-friendly "Connection Lost" recovery page, allowing users to manually retry the connection.
- **Improved Splash Status**: Added real-time status updates to the splash screen including "Waiting for local server..." and "Waiting for network (WiFi/LAN)...".
## [10.5.6] - 2026-03-06
### FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS
- **Promptless File Downloads**: Synced the "Predetermined Location" setting to the student app. When the teacher sends a file to the chat, it now automatically downloads in the background for all students without a browser prompt.
- **App Launch Domains**: The "Advanced" App Launch UI now automatically prefixes basic domain inputs (e.g., `google.gr`) with `http://` so they successfully launch via the default edge browser.
- **Monitoring PC Names**: Fixed an issue where the student's PC name (`os.hostname()`) was not being correctly passed to the grid, resulting in UI cards only showing the username.
- **DevTools Error**: Fixed the missing `filterWarning` DOM element reference that was producing a silent console error.
## [10.5.5-beta] - 2026-03-04
### NEW
- **Native PDF Viewer**: Completely removed the custom PDF.js implementation and reverted to Chromium's high-performance native PDF viewer. This resolves all "ERR_ABORTED" and worker-related loading issues.
- **Lock Screen Labels**: Updated "Lock Screen" buttons to "Lock all screens" (and Greek "Κλείδωμα όλων των οθονών") to better reflect its class-wide functionality.
- **Translation Restore**: Restored legacy translation keys (`btn-tool-lock-all-screens`, etc.) for better compatibility and consistency.

### FIXES
- **Viewer Stability**: Added internal guards to prevent unnecessary webview resets, eliminating console noise and potential browser crashes.
- **Cleanup**: Removed over 150 unused PDF.js library files and obsolete viewer logic.

## [10.5.2-beta2] - 2026-03-04
### FIXES
- **Settings Persistence**: Fixed "Auto-download" and "Startup" settings not persisting across application restarts.
- **Auto-download Default**: Blank download paths now correctly default to `[Desktop]`.
- **Registry Sync**: Fixed the "Start on Login" toggle to accurately reflect the Windows registry state on startup.

### UI/UX
- **System Tray**: Completely removed the right-click context menu from the tray icon for a cleaner experience (Double-click still opens the window).

## [10.5-beta] - 2026-03-02
### NEW
- **No Internet Tool**: Added a global and individual teacher tool to disable and restore student web access while maintaining local network communication.
- **PC Names**: New PC Name fild in the settings hidden and shown in the monitoring screens only for the teacher. PC names are asigned automaticaly with the order the PCs join the class the first time.

## [10.4-beta] - 2026-03-02
### NEW
- **Close All Apps**: Added a global and individual feature for teachers to close all running applications instantly.
- **Improved File Actions**: Enhanced file messages with "Send File" and "Open Action" buttons for better workflow.

### FIXES
- **Monitoring System**: Implemented critical fixes for the student monitoring system to improve reliability and performance.

## [10.3.0-beta] - 2026-03-01
### IMPROVEMENTS
- **Screen Share Bitrate**: Replaced connection-type presets (Auto/Ethernet/WiFi) with explicit bitrate options: 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 Mbps. Default is 16 Mbps.
- **Slider Fix**: AI moderation threshold sliders now correctly reflect saved values on load (fill position was not updating after settings were fetched from server).
- **Bitrate Dropdown Fix**: Dropdown no longer appears empty when a previously cached bitrate value is no longer valid — falls back to 16 Mbps automatically.
- **PDF Viewer**: Removed the floating black zoom toolbar. Maximize button moved to the modal header (Minimize / Maximize / Close).

## [10.2.1] - 2026-02-28
### IMPROVEMENTS

- **Maintenance**: General code cleanup, performance optimizations, and lazy loading implementation.

## [9.4.0] - 2026-02-21
### Added
- **System Messaging Redesign**: Completely overhauled the appearance of internal system messages (e.g. "User joined", "User left") to be contained within modern, centered pill designs. 
- **Dynamic Toasts**: Replaced bottom-floating, screen-blocking toasts with inline, color-coded notification pills that insert smoothly directly into the chat stream sequence.
- **File Transfer Progress Integration**: Unified the file upload and download indicator progress bars with the new "pill" design, creating a wholly consistent notification experience across the application.
